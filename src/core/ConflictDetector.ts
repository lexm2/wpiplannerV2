 * ConflictDetector - Schedule Conflict Analysis & Validation Engine
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURE ROLE:
 * - Analyzes time conflicts between course sections for schedule validation
 * - Core business logic component for schedule feasibility checking
 * - Validates schedule combinations and provides conflict resolution data
 * - Performance-optimized conflict detection with caching for large datasets
 * - Foundation for schedule generation and filtering systems
 * 
 * DEPENDENCIES:
 * - Section, Period, DayOfWeek types → Core academic data structures
 * - TimeConflict, ConflictType types → Conflict representation models
 * - Time utility functions → Time comparison and overlap calculations
 * 
 * USED BY:
 * - ScheduleController → Schedule visualization and conflict display
 * - ScheduleFilterService → Schedule generation and filtering operations
 * - CourseSelectionService → Real-time conflict checking during selection
 * - PeriodConflictFilter → Filtering schedules based on conflict constraints
 * - Schedule validation systems → Feasibility checking for generated schedules
 * 
 * CONFLICT DETECTION ARCHITECTURE:
 * ```
 * Sections Array Input
 *         ↓
 * Pairwise Section Comparison (with caching)
 *         ↓
 * Period-by-Period Analysis
 *         ↓
 * Day & Time Overlap Detection
 *         ↓
 * TimeConflict Objects Output
 * ```
 * 
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * Conflict Detection:
 * - detectConflicts() analyzes all section pairs for time overlaps
 * - checkSectionConflicts() compares individual section pairs
 * - checkPeriodConflict() validates specific period combinations
 * - Comprehensive conflict type identification (TIME_OVERLAP)
 * - Detailed conflict descriptions with specific times and days
 * 
 * Performance Optimization:
 * - Conflict caching with Map<string, TimeConflict[]> for repeated checks
 * - Symmetric cache keys (section1-section2 = section2-section1)
 * - O(n²) algorithm optimized with caching for practical performance
 * - clearCache() method for memory management in long-running sessions
 * - Efficient time comparison using minute-based calculations
 * 
 * Time Analysis System:
 * - hasTimeOverlap() uses interval overlap algorithm (start1 < end2 && start2 < end1)
 * - timeToMinutes() converts time objects to comparable integers
 * - getSharedDays() finds day intersections between period schedules
 * - Handles complex schedules with multiple periods per section
 * 
 * Schedule Validation:
 * - isValidSchedule() provides boolean feasibility check
 * - Conflict-free schedule validation for generation algorithms
 * - Integration with schedule filtering and recommendation systems
 * 
 * DATA STRUCTURES:
 * Conflict Cache:
 * - Key: "${crn1}-${crn2}" (sorted for symmetry)
 * - Value: TimeConflict[] (all conflicts between section pair)
 * - Automatic cache population on first conflict check
 * - Memory-efficient storage of computed results
 * 
 * TIME CONFLICT OUTPUT:
 * - section1/section2: References to conflicting sections
 * - conflictType: ConflictType enum (TIME_OVERLAP, etc.)
 * - description: Human-readable conflict explanation
 * - Includes specific days and time ranges for user feedback
 * 
 * INTEGRATION PATTERNS:
 * Schedule Generation Flow:
 * 1. Generate potential section combinations
 * 2. ConflictDetector validates each combination
 * 3. Filter out combinations with conflicts
 * 4. Present conflict-free schedules to user
 * 
 * Real-time Validation Flow:
 * 1. User selects course section
 * 2. ConflictDetector checks against existing selections
 * 3. Display conflicts in UI immediately
 * 4. Provide conflict resolution suggestions
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
 * - Time Complexity: O(n² × m²) where n=sections, m=periods per section
 * - Space Complexity: O(n²) for conflict cache storage
 * - Cache Hit Rate: High for repeated schedule validations
 * - Memory Usage: Configurable via cache clearing
 * - Optimized for WPI's typical 20-40 sections per schedule
 * 
 * CONFLICT DETECTION ALGORITHM:
 * 1. For each unique pair of sections:
 *    a. Check cache for previous analysis
 *    b. If not cached, analyze all period combinations
 *    c. For each period pair with shared days:
 *       - Convert times to minutes for comparison
 *       - Check for temporal overlap using interval mathematics
 *       - Create TimeConflict object if overlap detected
 *    d. Cache results for future queries
 * 2. Aggregate all conflicts across section pairs
 * 3. Return complete conflict list for schedule analysis
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS:
 * - Strategy: Pluggable conflict detection algorithms
 * - Cache: Performance optimization through result memoization
 * - Template Method: Consistent conflict checking workflow
 * - Value Object: TimeConflict represents immutable conflict state
 * - Singleton: Shared detector instance across application components
 * 
 * BENEFITS ACHIEVED:
 * - Fast conflict detection for interactive schedule building
 * - Comprehensive conflict analysis with detailed reporting
 * - Cache optimization reduces redundant calculations
 * - Scalable performance for large course datasets
 * - Clean integration with schedule generation systems
 * - User-friendly conflict descriptions for resolution guidance
 * 
 * FUTURE EXTENSIBILITY:
 * - Additional conflict types (ROOM_CONFLICT, PROFESSOR_CONFLICT)
 * - Soft conflict detection (back-to-back classes, lunch breaks)
 * - Priority-based conflict resolution recommendations
 * - Integration with real-time enrollment data
 * - Advanced caching strategies (LRU, TTL)
 *
